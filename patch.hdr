Hey Guys,

I pulled the latest awk down off of prep.ai.mit.edu.  Here are my changes.
The problems I found are

1. the tmpnam function for MSC 5.1 can't handle the template you gave it.
   It seems to object to the '.tmp' extension.

2. I added pipes.  The implementation is simple minded, but it works.

3. In the pathopen code, the code that loops through the path falls off the
   end.  It also requires that '.' be in the gawk path, which is something
   I'm not sure should be required.

4. There are some clashes in awk.h between the standard include files
   and the local definitions of malloc and realloc.  I may not be entirely
   together on this, as I've hacked up my bison.simple to not use alloca.
