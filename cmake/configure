# And the few other current configure options like --with-whiny-user-strftime,

# Anyone using this script still needs an out-of-source build directory.
# This script should first check if it was invoked from outside the source directory.
# Then it shall evaluate all the options and translate the options into CMake variables.
# Finally the script shall invoke CMake.
