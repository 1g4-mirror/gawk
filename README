README:

This is GNU Awk 2.00 Beta. It should be functionally equivalent to the
System V Release 4 awk. (Yes, you read that right.)

**** N O T I C E ****: Although the functionality is reasonably stable
and we think it relatively bug-free, the code itself is not stable and
the next release may look quite different.  In particular, the memory
management is in a state of flux and will be greatly changed (and
improved) in the next release.

Some additional features are under design/discussion with Randall
Howard at MKS and Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs.  Although they are
documented, they are subject to future change.

The gawk.1 man page is concise but (to the best of our knowledge) complete.
A gawk.texinfo is in the works. A preliminary draft exists, but has numerous
technical errors which are being fixed. It also will have to be reorganized.
Don't look for it for a while. However, the AWK book will do quite well.

Please coordinate changes through David Trueman and/or Arnold Robbins.
