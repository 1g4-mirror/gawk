README:

This is GNU Awk 2.03 Beta. It should be upwardly compatible with the
System V Release 4 awk. (Yes, you read that right.)

This represents a major improvement over the previous release. In
particular, most known bugs have been fixed, and the memory leaks have
been plugged.  However, the code continues to undergo steady evolution.
Known problems are given in the PROBLEMS file.

The gawk.1 man page is concise but (to the best of our knowledge) complete.
A gawk.texinfo is real close to ready.  It may even be included in this
distribution.  If so, it likely does not document all the new features
in 2.03 not in 2.02;  that will be rectified. For the moment, the man
page should be considered authoritative when it conflicts with the
gawk.texinfo file.

INSTALLATION:

The Makefile will need some tailoring.  Currently it is set up for
a Sun running SunOS 4.x.  The changes to make in the Makefile are
commented and should be obvious.

If you have neither bison nor yacc, use the awk.tab.c file here.  It was
generated with bison, and should have no AT+T code in it.  (Note that
modifying awk.y without bison or yacc will be difficult, at best.  You might
want to get a copy of bison from the FSF too.)

If you can't contact either of us, try Jay Fenlason, hack@prep.ai.mit.edu
AKA mit-eddie!prep!hack.  During odd hours he can sometimes be reached at
(617) 253-8975, which is an MIT phone in the middle of the corridor, so don't
be suprised if someone wierd answers, or if the person on the other end has
never heard of him.  (Direct them to the microvax about 10 feet to their left.)
