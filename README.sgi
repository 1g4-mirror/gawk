I have reports that gawk fails to pass its tests when compiled with gcc on
the IRIX, through gcc 2.5.7.  Therefore you should probably try compiling
with cc.  If gawk compiled with cc fails to pass its `make test', then I want
to hear about it.  Otherwise I will fuss at you for not reading the
documentation.
