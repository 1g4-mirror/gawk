Page 18. OK to move the sidebar although having it at the opening
is sort of like the opening quotes I have in other places; it's meant
to be humorous.

Page 10 - references to 'Chapter 10' and 'Chapter 11' have been left
alone since they are links and I can't do it that way in texinfo anyway.

Appendices vs. Appendixes:  I have left it as the former; the latter
looks totally wrong to me.

Numbers: I use the style where values from zero to nine are spelled
out and from 10 up they're written with digits. (I forget what the
Chicago Manual of Style calls this.) So I've rejected those changes.

C heads - I have not lowercased them; this would be incorrect
for the Texinfo, so I've marked them as Rejected but with a reply
in the PDF to please do this during production.

Literal layout blocks not being indented - I used literal layout to get
the brackets, which indicate optional stuff, in Roman.  I think that if you
simply fix the style sheets to indent those blocks, we should be in better
shape.

For me to think about: Page 396, where there's a full sentence in bold.

At page 438.
