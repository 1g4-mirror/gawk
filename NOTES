Page 18. OK to move the sidebar although having it at the opening
is sort of like the opening quotes I have in other places; it's meant
to be humorous.

Page 10 - references to 'Chapter 10' and 'Chapter 11' have been left
alone since they are links and I can't do it that way in texinfo anyway.

Appendices vs. Appendixes - I have left it as the former; the latter
looks totally wrong to me.

Numbers. I use the style where values from zero to nine are spelled
out and from 10 up they're written with digits. I forget what the
Chicago Manual of Style calls this. So I've rejected those changes.

C heads - I have not lowercased them; this would be incorrect
for the Texinfo, so I've marked them as Rejected but with a reply
in the PDF to please do this during production.

At page 222.
