This is a list of known problems in the current version of gawk.
Hopefully they will all be fixed in the next major release of gawk.

Please keep in mind that this is still beta software and the code
is still undergoing significant evolution.

1. Memory Management. Gawk has memory leaks. This version (12/23/88) is
   better than earlier versions, but still not wonderful.

2. Gawk reportedly does not work well with the BSD getopt. The getopt from
   gnu grep is reported to work fine.

3. The % operator truncates to integer. This will be fixed.

4. \ inside [] in regexps doesn't work like the book says they should.
   This will also be fixed.

5. %g does not seem to truncate non-significant zeros.

6. No gawk.texinfo; this is being worked on.

7. MS-DOS support. This version does not have it, although support for
   MSC 5.1 was recently contributed and will be included in the next
   major release.
