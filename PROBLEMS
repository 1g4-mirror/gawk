This is a list of known problems in gawk 2.03.
Hopefully they will all be fixed in the next major release of gawk.

Please keep in mind that this is still beta software and the code
is still undergoing significant evolution.

1. %g does not truncate non-significant zeros.
   gawk 'BEGIN { printf "%g\n", 1 }' should print "1", not "1.000000".

2. %d doesn't quite work either:
   echo 1 | gawk '{ printf "%0.2d\n", $1 }' should print "01", not "1".

3. The debugging code does not print redirection info.

4. The scanner needs an overhaul.

5. MS-DOS support. Since 2.03 is a major change over 2.02, we are chucking
   the ms-dos diffs for 2.02. However, the people who contributed it are
   working on a pre-release of 2.03, so this entry may go away for the
   release.
