This directory contains the tests for gawk.  The tests use the
following conventions.

Given some aspect of gawk named `foo', there will be one or more
of the following files:

foo.awk		--- actual code for the test if not inline in the Makefile
foo.in		--- the data for the test, if it needs data
foo.ok		--- the expected results
_foo		--- the actual results; generated at run time

The _foo file will be left around if a test fails, allowing you to
compare actual and expected results, in case they differ.
