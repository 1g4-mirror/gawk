This is the Beta-test distribution of gawk.  (Probably around version 1.01
or so.)

Please send all
bug-reports, comments, cries for help, etc, to hack@prep.ai.mit.edu
AKA mit-eddie!prep!hack  During odd hours I can sometimes be reached at
(617) 253-8975, which is an MIT phone in the middle of the corridor, so don't
be suprised if someone wierd answers, or if the person on the other end has
never heard of me.  (Direct them to the microvax about 10feet to their left.)

Gawk requires some berkeleyisms, like alloca(), bcopy(), index(), etc.  I
believe we have a portable version of alloca() (part of GNUemacs), and
probably the other stuff as well.  Send me mail if you need anything.

For real speed, you should change the Makefile to compile -O -DFAST and
disable the debugger.  (-DFAST replaces some function calls with macros, and
disables a lot of debugging stuff.)

If you don't have bison, modify the makefile to call yacc instead
(The proper commands should be already in the makefile; just un-comment them.)
If you have neither bison nor yacc, use the awk.tab.c file here.  It was
generated with bison, and should have no AT+T code in it.  (Note that
modifying awk.y without bison or yacc will be difficult, at best.  You might
want to get a copy of bison from us too.)
