* egtest

A script to test the programs/scripts included
in the Gawk book (both in the English original
and in the Italian translation).
No license is imbedded in the scripts, the
license of Gawk is implied.

The script should work when executed in the
distribution directory in which it is contained.
The position of its input (the gawk.texi files
that are in the distribution doc and doc/it
directories) is supposed to be at the same level
of the egtests directory, i.e.:

egtests
doc
doc/it

The script has one possible parameter, namely "it"
for Italian. Every other parameter (or no parameters)
will default to "en" for English.

egtest [it]

The script extracts both the original English and
the Italian programs/scripts from the Gawk book.

Only the programs/scripts in the selected language
are tested, but it is possible to compare each of
them with the corresponding program/script in the
other language.

All the testing is done in a "tmp" directory
created in egtests, which is removed at the exit
from the egtest script.
The script does NOT change any contents in the
egtests directory during the test.

The gawkeg script needs a number of pieces of
software, in order to test gawk extensions, etc.
It works only in a Linux/Unix environment, and requires:
the "gcc" compiler
the "cat" command
the "echo" command
the "grep" command
the "head" command
the "history" command
the "msgfmt" command
the "tail" command
the "vim" and "vimdiff" commands
the "/usr/share/dict/words" file

After calling egtest, the following prompt
is visualized:

===> Which test(s)? [1-nn,q,h,...]

Typing h<Enter>

...a list of the available options inside egtest
is shown:

Choose by number one or more tests to try
e.g.: 1-5,14,26-30
If a suffix is given, e.g.: 1e or: h
(alone or after a list of numbers)
h -- will just print this help text
d -- will invoke vimdiff for a test file in both languages
b -- will invoke vim for a test file
e -- will invoke vim for a test file
w -- will tell where a module is
q,Q,quit,x,ZZ,zz -- will exit from egtest
Everything else just has no effect
