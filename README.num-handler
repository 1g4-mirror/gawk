============================

This branch is an attempt to generalize number handling in gawk.
John Haque had it pretty much working when he abandoned the gawk project
in December 2012 and I have been carrying it forward since.

However, keeping it in sync with master is getting increasingly hard. For
example, not all the tests pass at this point, and I don't feel like
trying to make them do so, since it doesn't look like I will ever merge
this branch in.
