	* gawktexi.in (Limitations): Provide brief instructions
	on how to use use a temporary file in a script with
	the debugger.  Thanks to Holger Klene <h.klene@gmx.de>
	for the discussion.
	(Multiple Lines): Note that POSIX seems to require \n as
	separator for all values of FS, but that in reality it
	doesn't apply to regexps; this is a POSIX bug.
	(Options): Document clearly that if no -f or -e, anything
	after the program text is placed into ARGV and not
	parsed for options. Thanks to Neil Ormos <ormos-gnulists17@ormos.org>
	for the tip.
