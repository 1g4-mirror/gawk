	* configure.ac (AM_C_PROTOTYPES): Remove call to this macro.
	The comments in configure.ac said that the call to AM_C_PROTOTYPES
	was needed for dfa.h, synced from GNU grep; but this statement is
	not true anymore in grep since commit v2.5.4-24-g9b5e7d4 "replace
	AC_CHECK_* with gnulib modules", dating back to 2009-11-26.  Also,
	the support for automatic de-ANSI-fication has been deprecated in
	automake 1.11.2, and will be removed altogether in automake 1.12.
	* vms/vms-conf.h (PROTOTYPES, __PROTOTYPES): Remove these #define,
	they are not used anymore.
	* pc/config.h (PROTOTYPES): Likewise.

	* dfa.c: Move some decls to the top of their functions for
	C90 compilers.

	* builtin.c (do_strftime): Add check for negative / overflowed
	time_t value with fatal error. Thanks to Hermann Peifer
	<peifer@gmx.eu> for the bug report.
	* dfa.c (setbit_wc): Non-MBS version. Add a return false
	since VMS compiler doesn't understand that abort doesn't return.

2011-10-10         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	* builtin.c (do_sub): Init textlen to zero to avoid "may be
	used unitialized" warning. Thanks to Corinna Vinschen for
	pointing this out.
	* eval.c (unwind_stack): Add parentheses around condition in while
	to avoid overzealous warning from GCC.

2011-09-30  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

	* io.c (remap_std_file): Fix non-portable code that caused
	redirected "print" to fail if a previous read from standard input
	returned EOF.  Reported by David Millis <tvtronix@yahoo.com>.
	(remap_std_file): Per Eli's suggestion, removed the leading close
	of oldfd and will let dup2 do the close for us.

2011-10-09         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	MBS_SUPPORT isn't available to allow GCC dead code constant
	expression computation and dead code elimination to help out.

	* io.c (rsnullscan, get_a_record): Fix the cases where terminators

	<schot@A-Eskwadraat.nl>.

	Jeroen Schot <schot@A-Eskwadraat.nl>.

2011-09-21         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>

	* dfa.c, mbsupport.h: Sync with GNU grep. Large amount of changes
	that remove many ifdefs, moving many conditions for multibyte
	support into regular C code and relying GCC's dead code optimization
	to elimnate code that won't be needed.
	* dfa.c: For gawk, add a number of additional defines so that things
	will compile if MBS_SUPPORT is 0.
	* array.c, awk.h, awkgram.y, builtin.c, eval.c, field.c, main.c,
	node.c, re.c: Change `#ifdef MBS_SUPPORT' to `#if MBS_SUPPORT'.
	* awk.h, regex_internal.h: Move NO_MBSUPPORT handling to ...
	* mbsupport.h: ...here.

	return zero in case there was an error opening the file. 
	(has_endfile): Nuke global variable.
